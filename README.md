### @star-wars-characters

This project is built with Next.js that displays information about characters from the Star Wars universe. You can browse through a list of characters, view detailed information about each of them, and filter characters home world/planets. The application fetches data from [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) and presents it in an easy-to-navigate interface.
